# Repo for a Rust tutorial on Actix and the Diesel ORM.

You can find the video series
[here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBok0UdvO6519tl0LzER8w_J-0pcro7q9).

**Update: October, 2021**

While this tutorial may still be helpful, Rust has been moving quite fast in
recent years and you'd do best to look around and see if Diesel is still the
best choice.

NOTE that Actix is actively maintained and some of the codes may be deprecated
by the time you use them.

As of July 2022, Actix-Web 4 is out and the videos are not updated yet.

This is an updated version that does not have any videos explaining it.

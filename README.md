You can find the video series [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBok0UdvO6519tl0LzER8w_J-0pcro7q9). 

**Update: October, 2021** 

While this tutorial may still be helpful, Rust has been moving quite fast in recent years and you'd do best to look around and see if Diesel is still the best choice.

# Weekly Writing Contest

This is a site I started back in early 2020, but the idea was something I'd been thinking about for some time. After developing it I decided to leave it as a portfolio project or perhaps something someone can learn something from. I'm by no means an expert, and this code could probably stand to be cleaned up. 

The site is up and running, though I'm not doing much to actively maintain it. Site can be found here, and you can use **demo/demopass** to play around with it or create an account if you'd like.
